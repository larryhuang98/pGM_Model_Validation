# pGM_Model_Validation
This repo is for the data and input files to validate the performance of pGM model under NVE, NVT and NPT simulation ensembles.

The analysis includes analyzing the average value and fluctuation of the potential energy distribution and the dynamical properties using autocorrelation function
